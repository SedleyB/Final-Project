# Final-Project

Difficulties:

As I stated in my Progress Report my original concept was to have the pong game but every time a player (either the ai or human) score would be even they would activate
a powerup. There would've been 4 powerups in total the first one was doubling the player's paddle length, the second one was doubling the player's paddle speed, the
third one was cutting the enemy's paddle length in half, and lastly the fourth one was diving the enemy's paddle speed in half. With these powerups I wanted to create a 
project where like I mentioned earlier, if the ai or player score was even then one of the powerups would randomly activate and last until someone scored a point.
But I couldn't quite fiqure out how to make the powerups randomly activate along with some other bugs like the paddle not moving in certain scenarios, which concluded in
me choosing to change my idea for the final project in order to have a finished product.

What I Learned:

Starting this project I knew nothing about creating games with code let alone things like lua or love, which is why I decided to do this particular project. I was
already interested in the idea but what really finalized my decision was that we could essentially use the final project to learn something and have fun with it at that 
moment I knew Pong was going to be my final project. As I mentioned earlier I knew nothing about game development so I watched the CS50 videos time after time in order 
to familiarize myself with the code that was given. So one thing I've learned while doing this project is that rarely will things go smoothly. Throughtout the process 
I've run into so many bumps along the road but whenever I figured out how to tackle the problem and solve it, It gave me satisfaction that I was able to not only 
identify a problem but solve it which made me more confident in my abilities to write code. Another thing I've learned is that I've become more familiar with lua given 
that I had to rewatch the CS50 videos multiple times to understand the code and read the lua programming manual I believe that I've become at the very least more 
comfortable with lua and given that a couple of weeks ago I knew pratically nothing about lua I'd say that's an improvement.

What I Enjoyed:

There were many things I enjoyed about this project but the main parts I enjoyed was just learning. I enjoyed reading the lua programming manual whenever I was stuck on 
something. I also enjoyed rewatching the CS50 videos whenever I was confused about a particular part in the code. Lastly, the part I enjoyed the most was being able to 
find solutions to the problems. As I mentioned earlier I said it gave me satisfaction whenever I solved something or when something worked as I intended, which is why 
enjoyed it the most. Seeing code that I've written work as intened is definitely the best part about the project because as I mentioned earlier essentially seeing code 
that I've written basically "come to life" gives me a sense of accomplishment.
