# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

	I will be doing the Pong project

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

	In summary, I will be recreating a pong game where the platform deflects the ball

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

	In summary like I mentioned above, I plan to create a pong game in which the platfrom deflects the ball.
I plan on making the ball go in random directions at random moments in the game. I also plan on adding powerups for example, one that extends the platform or one that
creates multi balls. I plan on excuting it by looking ar the module and if I still need assistence then I plan on reading books or something of that nature to help me
complete the task.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

	I have alot I want to do for this project, but I will try to complete is being able to make the platform reflect the ball.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

	If I have enough time, I hope I can add more crazy powerups or something of that nature

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

	The best outcome is that I not only finished what I need to accomplish but also being able to add all of the extra powerups that I want

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

	I need to acquire how pong is created first and foremost. Secondly, I need to be able to understand the LOVE framework so that the game can run. 
Thirdly, I need to understand and read about in order to make it work. Lastly, being able to understand how to write in lua so I make the game run.
